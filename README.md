# TSP using Genetic Algorithm

## Introduction
This Python project implements a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a Genetic Algorithm. 

## Input File Format
Ensure that your input file is in the correct format for the `inp_reader` function to read. You can modify this function to match your specific input file format.

## Algorithm Overview
The project uses a Genetic Algorithm to find an optimal solution to the TSP. It starts with a population of chromosomes, where each chromosome represents a possible path through the cities. The algorithm then evolves this population over multiple generations by selecting the best individuals (chromosomes), performing crossover and mutation operations, and creating a new generation of chromosomes.

## Results
The algorithm will keep running for a specified number of iterations, and the best solution found so far will be printed at the end.
